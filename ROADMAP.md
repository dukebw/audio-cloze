# Roadmap

What’s next only. Completed work lives in `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Next up

- Review UI: keyboard shortcuts, status filter, search, dark mode
- Anki export: AnkiConnect + batch export + custom note type
- Fallback when a word isn’t indexed: synonym suggestions + auto search + on‑the‑fly indexing
- More sources: Bilibili, local audio with transcripts, WenetSpeech

## Maybe later

- Sentence difficulty scoring
- Spaced repetition integration
- Multi-language support
- Web UI (Flask/FastAPI)
- Pre-built index distribution

## Technical debt

- Network failure handling + resume indexing
- Clip deduplication
- Tests
